Classes in DND have been a thing since its inception. However, a problem that has become more and more apparent with each player who plays DND is the clear disbalance of classes and how powerful they are vs how powerful they should be. Below is a showcase of how I intend to balance the classes. Also classes will work a bit different. Instead subclasses are a level one thing and each class will have a basic subclass that basically replaces if you were to not choose a class. Opting for a stronger base class type features.

## [[Rework of Fighter Subclasses]]

## [[Rework of Barbarian]]

### [[Rework of Monk]] (1 Subclass that needs to be reworked)

### [[Rework of Paladin]] 

### [[Rework of Rogue]]

### [[Rework of Ranger]]

### [[Rework of Artificer]]

### [[Rework of Bard]]

### [[Rework of Cleric]]

### [[Rework of Druid]]

### [[Rework of Sorcerer]]

### [[Rework of Warlock]]

### [[Rework of Wizard]]
