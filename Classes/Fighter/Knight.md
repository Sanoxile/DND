**_Knights have undergone some basic training due to their military service. Some knights have even inherited the job from their family members. This is why most knights have plate armor. These knights have been taught to be on the frontlines and hold back the masses. This makes them the perfect frontliner in a party. While rare some knights do leave the military, it is rare. Most adventurers who are knights have finished their career or are looking to find a different way to help the country._**


REWORK THE WORDING OF THE ABILTIES

### Proficiencies
**Saving Throws:** Strength, Constitution

### War cry
You scream out a war cry enraging all nearby enemies within 30 feet of you. All enemies must succeed on a DC 10 + your strength modifier + proficiency bonus or they will be given disadvantage when attacking anyone besides you.

If the enemy is immune to being charmed they will be completely unaffected by this war cry.

### Family Blessings
At level three your family has deemed you worthy to accept your family heirloom. A set of plate armor that has been just freshly repurposed. This set of armor will serve you well.

Along with the armor your family sent a scroll with some secrete fighting styles. Choose one of the two options below...

- Defense fighting style, Protection fighting style and a shield.
- Two weapon fighting style, Unarmed fighting style, and Blind fighting style.

### Battle Hardened
At level seven you gain the ability to help people in one of the three ways listed below, twice per long rest.

- As a reaction you can choose to defend a teammate. Doing this lets you roll for their saving throw rather than them doing it.
- As a reaction you can command a teammate (if they want to) to move up to 30-feet.
- You attempt to block a teammate from taking damage. You can move up to 15-feet and block if with 5-feet of them. If it was an AOE attack they take half damage and you take full.

### Defensive Empowerment
At level ten you gain the ability to empower your allies to use defensive maneuvers. Anyone within 30-feet of you will receive +2 to their AC for one round after using action surge.


### Power Through
At level fifteen you unlock the ability to power through once per long rest. Once knocked out you can choose to fight like normal for 1 turn as if you weren't knocked out. After this turn you will go back to your previous state.

### Heart of a Champion
At level seventeen you gain the ability to crit on 19's as well as 20's
